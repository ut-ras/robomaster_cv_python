### Make Robotics Field
#### Samik
Objective: Have our field in the simulation
We need to add our robomasters field into the simulation
An example of how the simulation wants the world can be found at `VEXU_GHOST/ghost_sim/urdf/spin_up.world` (it is in meters)
 * Bottom left is 0,0 on map
 * Units is meters

### Real LIDAR data
Objective: Load real lidar data into sim
We now have a real lidar and it would be nice to fuck around with it and we'll need to know how to set up the lidar later
 * LIDAR data from actual sensor streamed to ROS
 * LIDAR data visualized in simulation

### UART
Work with Paul to get data from embeded.
 * Creates a topic for embeded data and sends the data to the respective topic in sim

### Depth Learning Project 
#### Leo
Objective: Learn how ROS subscribers and publishers work by making one for depth calculations
There is a LIDAR publisher out there that spits out angles and distances; this is a learning project to figure out how ros works.
 * Subscribe to the published and publish the distance to whats right in front of you.
 * Show what you did to team and depth (most imporant)
Here is how to run a demo subscriber and publisher that are already installed via the docker file or can be installed pretty easily:

### Setting up URDF
#### Samik, Tanay
Objective: We will be creating the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) file for a simple differential drive robot to give you hands-on experience on working with URDF. We will also setup the robot state publisher and visualize our model in RVIZ. Lastly, we will be adding some kinematic properties to our robot URDF to prepare it for simulation purposes. These steps are necessary to represent all the sensor, hardware, and robot transforms of your robot for use in navigation.

### Mecanum in Sim
#### Leo, Tanay
Objective: Get _roughly_ our robot in the simulation with mecanum wheels
This is top priority and whill be necessary for all our tuning. Maxx put some stuff about this in discord so read over that and look into the plugin he found. Implement it or find a better solution.

### Run the Sim
#### Aditya, Leo
Objective: Be able to use the simulation
Learn the ins and outs of the simulation.
 * How do I tell robot where to go. Whats it doing on the backend. As much of that jazz as you can.
 * Show what you did to team (most imporant)

### Lidar Research
#### Samik, Tanay, Will, Hasif
Objective: We have a lot to learn
See Lidar Max Debrief.md for a chatGPT summary from our chat with Maxx. Pay attention to the links at the botton from Maxx. Understand it and be able to explain it

### Command Velocity Fix (Polish Mecanum Wheel Work)
#### Tanay
Right now, some command velocities work and other dont and changing up what direction you go in doesn't work. Fix that
 * any twist published to cmd_vel, robot goes in that direction
 * robot can change direction when new
 * cmd_vel topic is configured in `sentry_base.xacro` and the topic is published to in the mecanum_plugin folder
 * command to publish to the cmd_vel topic is ```ros2 topic pub cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 1, y: 0, z: 0}}‚Äù```

### Particle Filter Fix
#### Leo
Particle filter currently not publish stuff. Figure out why and get it to publish
 * Particle cloud published to /particle_cloud topic
 * /estimation/robot_pose also works by intating particle cloud
