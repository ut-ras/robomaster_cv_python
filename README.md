Repo for lidar implementation 

## Goals and Ideas
List of goals and rough ideas for implementation. Where in code will we implement, etc.

- Account for 1ยบ (account for tilt in LIDAR calculation)
    - 
- Angle Calibration (calibrate to accurantly measure our tilt)
    - 
- Depth Calculation (how far away is an object at a given an angle (or withing angle range))
