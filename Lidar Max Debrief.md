<h1>Particle Filters in LIDAR-based Autonomous Robots</h1>
<br>
<p>Particle filters, also known as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL), are a popular method for estimating the position and orientation of an autonomous robot using LIDAR sensor data.</p>

<p>In a particle filter, the robot's environment is represented by a set of particles, each representing a possible location and orientation for the robot. The particles are initially distributed randomly throughout the environment, and as the robot moves and receives LIDAR measurements, the particles are updated to reflect the new information.
<br>
The updating process is done through a two-step process called prediction and update. In the prediction step, the particles are moved based on the robot's control inputs, such as its velocity and angular velocity. In the update step, the particles are resampled based on their weight, which is a measure of how likely each particle is to represent the true location and orientation of the robot.
<br>
The weight of each particle is determined by comparing the LIDAR measurements to the simulated measurements that would be expected from the particle's location and orientation. Particles that have simulated measurements that are similar to the actual measurements are given a higher weight than particles that have dissimilar measurements.
<br>
After the resampling, the particles with the highest weight are used to estimate the robot's position and orientation. This estimate is then used for controlling the robot's movement and for planning its path.
<br>
One of the advantages of using particle filters is that they can handle non-linear and non-Gaussian systems, which is common in real-world environments. Additionally, they can handle multi-modal distributions, which means that there may be multiple possible locations and orientations for the robot that are consistent with the sensor data.
<br>
However, particle filters can be computationally expensive and require a large number of particles to achieve good performance. Additionally, the performance of particle filters can degrade in environments with limited sensor data or in the presence of significant amounts of noise.
<br>
Overall, particle filters are a powerful method for localizing LIDAR-based autonomous robots, but they require careful tuning and implementation to achieve good performance.

In the Robot Operating System (ROS), topics are used for communication between nodes. Nodes can publish messages to a topic, and other nodes can subscribe to that topic to receive the messages.
<br>
To create a topic, a node must first advertise it using the ros::NodeHandle::advertise() function. This function takes the name of the topic and the message type as arguments and returns a publisher object. Once the topic is advertised, the node can use the publisher object to publish messages to the topic using the publish() function.
<br>
For example, consider a node that publishes a message of type std_msgs::String on a topic called "chat":
<br>
c
Copy code

```
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <std_msgs/String.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ros::init(argc, argv, "talker");
  ros::NodeHandle n;

  ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>("chat", 1000);

  ros::Rate loop_rate(10);

  while (ros::ok()) {
    std_msgs::String msg;
    msg.data = "Hello, ROS!";

    chatter_pub.publish(msg);

    ros::spinOnce();
    loop_rate.sleep();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

<br>
On the other hand, to subscribe to a topic, a node must use the ros::NodeHandle::subscribe() function, which takes the name of the topic and the message type as arguments and returns a subscriber object. Once the node has a subscriber object, it can use the ros::Subscriber::subscribe() function to specify a callback function that will be called each time a message is received on the topic.
<br>
For example, consider a node that subscribes to the "chat" topic and prints the messages to the console:
<br>
c
Copy code

```
#include <ros/ros.h>
#include <std_msgs/String.h>

void chatterCallback(const std_msgs::String::ConstPtr& msg) {
  ROS_INFO("I heard: [%s]", msg->data.c_str());
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  ros::init(argc, argv, "listener");
  ros::NodeHandle n;

  ros::Subscriber sub = n.subscribe("chat", 1000, chatterCallback);

  ros::spin();

  return 0;
}
```

<p>
It's important to note that in order for nodes to be able to communicate with each other, they must be running in the same ROS master. Additionally, nodes must also have the appropriate message type defined in order to be able to publish or subscribe to a topic.

We need to tune the LIDAR system for the particular field after the A&M scrim.

Odometery data is used to generate a bunch of particles. The particles are then updated based on the LIDAR data. The particles are then resampled based on their weight. The particles with the highest weight are used to estimate the robot's position and orientation. This estimate is then used for controlling the robot's movement and for planning its path.
