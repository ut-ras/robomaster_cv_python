# Setting Up LIDAR container

## Required Software
* Docker
* VNC Viewer (this installation was tested with [real vnc](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/), but any should do)

## Helpful Commands
* `git submodule update --init --force` : initialize submodules
* `docker build . -t <image-name>` : create image
* `docker run -it -p 22:22 --name <container-name> <image-name>` : create container
* `docker run -it -p 22:22 --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=<container-path> --name <container-name> <image-name>` : create container
* `docker container start <container-name>` : start container
* `docker exec -it <container-name> bash` : access container's terminal
* `ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 <username>@$(ipconfig getifaddr en0) "x11vnc -create -nopw -listen 127.0.0.1 -localhost"` : start vnc server
* `startxfce4` : start GUI
* `bash ~/VEXU_GHOST/scripts/init_container.sh` : initialize container
* `bash ~/VEXU_GHOST/scripts/launch_sim.sh` : launch simulation
* `ros2 topic list` : list topics
* `ros2 topic pub cmd_vel --once geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 1, y: 0, z: 0}}"` : publish message to cmd_vel

## Setup Steps
0. Init the .gitmodules by running `git submodule update --init --force` from the `robomaster_CV` directory. The directory `robomaster_CV/VEXU_GHOST/ghost_estimation/src/shared` should have stuff in it after force initing the submodules.
1. Build the Dockerfile by navigating to this directory (`robomaster_CV/VEXU_GHOST`) and running the command `docker build . -t ros2-foxy`.
2. Create a container from the image using `docker run -it -p 22:22 --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/root/VEXU_GHOST --name LIDAR ros2-foxy` (this must also be run from this directory). You're now running bash in the container. Navigate to the `/root/VEXU_GHOST/scripts` folder and run `init_container.sh`. Type `exit` to leave the container.
    * Note that `-p 22:22` maps the container's port 22 to your local port 22; only one container at a time can be bound to your local port 22.
    * `init_container.sh` isn't run from the Dockerfile because it requires the VEXU_GHOST module to run which is mounted at container creation. This installs all the dependencies, builds the project, and adds some lines to the `.bashrc`.
    * The docker file will create a user for you that defaults to the username `lidar` with password `password`. To change these defaults, add `--build-arg USERNAME=<your-username>` and/or `--build-arg PASSWORD=<your-password>` to the `docker build` line.
3. Start the container via the docker GUI or by running `docker container start LIDAR` and then _on your local machine_ run the command `ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 lidar@$(ipconfig getifaddr en0) "x11vnc -create -nopw -listen 127.0.0.1 -localhost"` to establish a vnc server in the container and pipe it to localhost:5900. Unless you changed it during the previous step, the password is "password".
    * If you changed your username in step 2, change "lidar" to your username.
    * It is annoying to copy and paste this command every time so it's helpful to alias it by adding `alias lidarvnc="ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 lidar@$(ipconfig getifaddr en0) \"x11vnc -create -nopw -listen 127.0.0.1 -localhost\""` to your shell initialization script.
4. Use your VNC Viewer to connect with `localhost:5900` and type `startxfce4` in the terminal that appears; a GUI should form.
5. Open a new terminal and run `sudo -i` to launch a root session and navigate to `/root/VEXU_GHOST/scripts`. Run `bash launch_sim.sh` and the rviz simulation should start up!
    * You may need to change from world frame to base link in the dropdown in the upper left-hand corner for the simulation to work properly. Ideally, the world frame will be created in the future.

## Development Environment
It's a pain in the ass to write code on the container and move it back onto your local machine – especially without an IDE on the container. You should never be subjugated to that, so we'll use Bind Mounts and/or Dev Container to write code on your IDE of choice on your machine (i.e. not the container). We just use the container for running the simulation and nothing else – write code locally.
### Bind Mount
When you use the flag `--mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/root/VEXU_GHOST` in step 2, you're telling Docker to use this directory (`VEXU_GHOST`) as `/root/VEXU_GHOST` in the container. They're bound together (hence bind mount). Any changes you make in the container will appear in your `VEXU_GHOST` and vice versa. This makes pushing and editing code much easier than inside the terminal.
### Dev Containers
Dev Containers is a VScode extension used in addition to a bind mount that offers some benefits and drawbacks. Drawback #1: only works for VScode users. Drawback #2: when you edit code in a container with Dev Containers, VEXU_GHOST won't be synced to git so your changes won't appear in source control; everything you do will still be editing the underlying `VEXU_GHOST` folder on your machine, you'll just need to open you're machine's `VEXU_GHOST` to see the difference with our branch. Benefit #1: access to all of your container's filesystem (helpful in some cases). Benefit #2: it execs into the container's terminal automatically when you open a new VScode terminal (no need to use `docker exec`).
First, add the extension [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). Then click the green "><" in the lower left corner of VScode and select "Attach to Running Container..." then select the container your using. Simple as that.

## Troubleshooting
* Running `xeyes` (and having some eyes follow your mouse around the scene) is a good way to check basic x11 forwarding is working.
* If get "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!" when trying to ssh into the container, you may need to remove the known_host files in your local .ssh directory. Note that this should only happen if you change up your container and you should take caution when doing this especially if you ssh into other devices. Do some research first.
* If you get the error "fatal: mot a git repository", navigate to the VEXU_GHOST folder and run "git init" and then "git submodule add https://github.com/MaxxWilson/amrl_shared_lib.git ghost_estimation/src/shared". This error happens when git initializes in a funny manner.

* Here is an explanation of our VNC setup that may help you work through issues <https://jasonmurray.org/posts/2021/x11vnc/>
* When we VNC into a user account, we only give that user x11 forwarding authorization and have to essentially copy the credentials from the user to root so we can do the simulation from root. This is all done programmatically now, but this link covers how it is done manually <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/476290/x11-forwarding-does-not-work-if-su-to-another-user>
